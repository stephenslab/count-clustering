\caption{Structure plot of estimated membership proportions for GoM model with $K=6$ clusters fit to $259$ single cells from  \cite{Deng2014}. The cells are ordered
by their preimplantation development phase (and within each phase, sorted by the proportional representation of the clusters). While the very earliest developmental phases
(zygote and early 2-cell) are essentially assigned to a single cluster, others have membership in multiple clusters. Each cluster is annotated by
the genes that are most distinctively expressed in that cluster, and by the gene ontology categories for which these distinctive genes are most enriched (see Table \ref{tab:tab3} for more extensive annotation results). See text for discussion of biological processes driving these results.}
