{\bf Circular dendrogram of hierarchical clustering results for GTEx brain tissues samples.} Alternative visual representation of \nameref{figS9}. Circular representation of the dendrogram makes the tissue labels easier to read. Samples from different brain regions seem to cluster together. In particular, Brain Cerebellar, Cerebellar Hemisphere, Brain Spinal Cord, and Substantia Nigra seem to cluster together and separate from samples from other brain regions. But, because of the large number of samples, patterns of structural variation between tissue samples remain difficult to detect.
