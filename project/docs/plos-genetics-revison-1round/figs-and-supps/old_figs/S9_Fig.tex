{\bf Hierarchical clustering results visualization of GTEx brain tissue samples.} Hierarchical clustering of Euclidean distance based on complete linkage was applied to 1,259 GTEx brain tissue samples. Data was transformed to log counts per million (CPM) prior to clustering. Complete linkage method was used to plot the Dendrogram. The colors represent different brain tissue types. We note that the sample labels in the Dendrogram are not easy to read because of the large sample size. However, there seems to be a separation between cerebellum, cerebellar hemisphere, spinal cord, and substantia nigra from other parts of the brain.
