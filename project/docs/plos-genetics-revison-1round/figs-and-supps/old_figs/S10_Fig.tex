{\bf Dendrogram visualization of hierarchical clustering results of mouse pre-implantation embryos data from Deng et al (2014).} Hierarchical clustering of Euclidean distance based on complete linkage was applied to 259 single cell samples from Deng et al., (2014). Data was transformed to log counts per million (CPM) prior to clustering. The colors represent different developmental phases. Although samples from different developmental stages seem to cluster together, the samples are not arranged in a continuum according to their developmental stages.
