{\bf Dendrogram visualization of hierarchical clustering results of GTEx V6 tissue samples.} Hierarchical clustering of Euclidean distance based on complete linkage was applied to 8,555 tissue samples from the GTEx V6 data. Data was transformed to log counts per million (CPM) prior to clustering. Complete linkage method was used to plot the Dendrogram. The colors represent different tissue types. Samples from different tissues seem to cluster together, but any further patterns. However, because of the large number of samples, patterns of structural variation between tissue samples remain difficult to detect.
