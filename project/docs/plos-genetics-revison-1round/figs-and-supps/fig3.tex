\caption{Structure plot of estimated membership proportions for GoM model with $K=7$ clusters fit to $1,041$ single cells from \cite{Jaitin2014}. The samples (cells) are ordered so that samples from the same amplification batch are adjacent and within each batch, the samples are sorted by the proportional representation of the underlying clusters. In this analysis the samples do not appear to form clearly-defined clusters, with each sample being allocated membership in several ``clusters". Membership proportions are correlated with batch, and some groups of batches (e.g. 28-29; 32-45) show similar palettes.  These results suggest that batch effects are likely influencing the inferred structure in these data.}
