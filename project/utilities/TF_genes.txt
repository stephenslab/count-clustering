11614	nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 1		  		Jared Roach	TF Gene		DNA-Binding: sequence-specific	NR0B1 and NR0B2 when analyzed by NCBI's "Conserved Domain" tool show only the HOLI domain (Ligand binding domain of hormone receptors [smart00430]). HMMER hmmpfam analysis of human NR0B1 with the Pfam database shows PF00104.17 (Ligand-binding domain of nuclear hormone) as the top hit with a E-value of 4.3e-28, and PF02037.14 (SAP domain) as a distant second with and E-value of 0.00041. The SAP (after SAF-A/B, Acinus and PIAS) motif is a putative DNA binding domain found in diverse nuclear proteins. The NCBI GEnRIF for human NR0B1 states "This gene encodes a protein that contains a DNA-binding domain", while the entry for human NR0B2 states "The protein encoded by this gene is an unusual orphan receptor that contains a putative ligand-binding domain but lacks a conventional DNA-binding domain". Indeed, the canonical length of human NR0B1 is 470 AA, while the canonical length of human NR0B2 is 257 AA, consistent with the presence an extra domain (e.g., DNA binding) in NR0B1. HMMER hmmpfam analysis of human NR0B2 with the Pfam database shows PF00104.17 (Ligand-binding domain of nuclear hormone) as the top hit with a E-value of  6.9e-32, and PF03681.4 (Uncharacterised protein family) as a distant second with and E-value of 0.0022. Together, these considerations suggest that NR0B1 is a DNA-binding TF, and NR0B2 does not bind DNA, and is rather a co-factor.	16709599	TF PPI	Other	Medium	In mammals: "DAX1 (NR0B1), and SHP (NR0B2) are atypical nuclear receptor superfamily members that function primarily as corepressors through heterodimeric interactions with other nuclear receptors."

																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																																				    12608	  CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), beta	  Zipper-Type Group/Leucine Zipper Family Shannan HoSui		TF Gene	     DNA-Binding: sequence-specific; Transcription Factor Binding: tf co-factor binding	     C/EBPs are a group of basic leucine zipper transcription factors identified by their sequence-specific binding to the CCAAT motifs in DNA. There are six different C/EBP family members that have been cloned and characterized. All members share homology at the bZIP domain and are multifunctional proteins that exhibit a diverse set of cellular responses like differentiation, inflammatory response, liver regeneration, metabolism etc. The target genes of the C/EBP family members are diverse and various studies have shown that C/EBP can modulate the expression of various matrix genes critical for osteoblast differentiation such as pro-{alpha}1 and -{alpha}2 type I collagen, matrix Gla protein, and osteocalcin. In most cases C/EBP{beta} can form a homodimer and bind to its recognition sequence; however C/EBP{beta} can also intraheterodimerize with other members of the family as well as with a variety of bZIP proteins such as CREB, C/ATF, and AP1. C/EBP{beta} has two major isoforms, liver-enriched activator protein (LAP), which is normally reported to be an activator and liver-enriched inhibitory protein (LIP), which lacks most of the trans -activation domain of LAP and thus acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor. Thus, C/EBP{beta} can directly activate or inhibit target gene expression.	15308669	Co-activation; DNA Binding; TF PPI; Transactivation	Rat	Strong	Initial transfections with different C/EBP ({alpha}, {beta}, {gamma}, and {delta}) members clearly showed that only the C/EBP{beta} expression plasmid can act as a repressor for the DSPP promoter (data not shown). We then defined the inhibitory role of C/EBP{beta} on the transcriptional activity of the DSPP gene using a luciferase assay. CMV-driven C/EBP{beta} expression plasmid was transfected with a luciferase reporter in odontoblasts. An increase in concentration of C/EBP{beta} DNA results in a corresponding decrease in the DSPP promoter activity.  Individually, C/EBPb and Nrf1 repress DSPP promoter activity to ~50% of initial levels. Synergistically, they reduce activity to 10% as measured by luciferase assay.To test whether Nrf1 and C/EBP{beta} mutually interact with each other in vivo, cell extracts were prepared from odontoblasts, and the immunoprecipitation assay was carried out with a monoclonal C/EBP{beta} antibody. The presence of Nrf1 in immunoprecipitates was detected by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody against Nrf1.The direct interaction of Nrf1 and C/EBP{beta} to their putative binding sites on the DSPP promoter was analyzed by EMSA. Protein components from nuclear extracts of odontoblasts formed a clear complex with oligonucleotides containing Nrf1 and C/EBP{beta} binding sequences. The binding of Nrf1 and C/EBP{beta} was confirmed by antibody-mediated supershift. Further, with Nrf1 and C/EBP{beta} antibodies together, a slower migration of the total complex in the gel was observed. EMSA results from the mutated oligonucleotides showed that mutation at the Nrf1 binding site did not affect the binding of C/EBP{beta}, and mutation at the C/EBP{beta} binding site had no effect on the binding of Nrf1 to the DSPP promoter.To map the Nrf1 and C/EBP{beta} domain that is required for mutual interaction, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments using deletion constructs in pCMV-3XFLAG vectors. Deletions were made at the leucine zipper region of Nrf1 (685�717 amino acids) and C/EBP{beta} (264�285 amino acids). Immunoprecipitation with FLAG antibody followed by cross-blotting with C/EBP{beta} or Nrf1 antibody showed that deletion of the leucine zipper region of either Nrf1 or C/EBP{beta} affected their physical interaction with each other. Deletion of Nrf1 showed that the 480�580 region of the protein  was necessary for its inhibitory activity and did not influence binding with C/EBP{beta}. Thus, Nrf1 and C/EBP{beta} mutually interact with each other through their leucine zipper domain.

The deletion of the element suppressed C/EBP�-induced osteocalcin gene promoter activity, whereas the deletion did not affect Runx2-induced promoter activity, as shown by luciferase assay. These data indicate that C/EBP� regulates the osteocalcin gene promoter through association with its DNA binding element. Furthermore, a coimmunoprecipitation experiment confirmed that C/EBP� physically associates with Runx2. Together with the cooperative effects of C/EBP� and Runx2 on ALP activity, these results indicate that C/EBP� controls osteoblast differentiation of mesenchymal cells through a physical association with Runx2.A naturally occurring isoform of C/EBP�, LIP, exhibits a dominant-negative effect on adipogenesis due to a lack of the transcriptional activation domain. Overexpression of LIP inhibits C/EBP�-induced adipocytic differentiation in C3H10T1/2 cells. LIP overexpression also inhibits the PPAR{gamma} gene promoter activity transactivated by C/EBP� and C/EBP{delta} (luciferase assay).

It has been shown to bind specifically to the E74 oligonucleotide which contains the GGAA core.  Mutation analysis shows that the first G is required for binding.  Elf5 is preferentially expressed in tissues with a high content of epithelial cells.   Oettgen et al. suggest that sequence specific DNA binding is modulated by the the first 46 nucleotides of Elf5.  Elf5 transactivates promoters from several salivary gland and prostate gland specific genes in luceriferase assays.		9840936	     DNA Binding; Transactivation	Mouse	Strong	A recombinant Elf5 HIS-tag protein of approximately 29 kD, expressed in E. coli and purified by metal-a�nity chromatography, displayed strong binding to consensus ETS binding sites, as analysed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Elf5 bound the E74 oligonucleotide (containing a GGAA-core), but not to the E74m1 oligonucleotide (which had been mutated to an AGAA-core). The first G-residue of the core has been demonstrated to be a physical point of DNA contact for ETS1, and consequently essential for DNA binding. These results were confirmed through competition analysis. The Elf5-E74 complex was effi�ciently competed by the addition of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled E74 but not by E74m1. Elf5 also displayed sequence specific binding to diff�erent consensus ETS binding sequences, and did so with diff�erential affi�nity. Competition of the Elf5-E74 complex was achieved by consensus ETS sites from the GM-CSF promoter, erb-B2 promoter, and moloney sarcoma virus (MSV) long terminal repeat (LTR). Elf5 did not appear to be competed at all by an oligonucleotide containing a consensus AP1 binding site.A reporter construct, containing the chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase (CAT) driven by a minimal TK promoter and multiple ETS/AP1 binding sites (from the polyomavirus enhancer), was co-transfected into COS cells together with an Elf5 expression construct. Analysis of CAT activities revealed that Elf5 expression resulted in an average fivefold transactivation of the reporter. Further, this transactivation was inhibited by addition of an anti-sense Elf5 mRNA expression vector, indicating that Elf5 transactivation was due specifically to the product translated from the sense construct.

This was demonstrated by synthesizing full-length ESE-2a and a truncated ESE-2aDelta 42, lacking the first 42 amino acids at the amino terminus, and performing EMSA with the E74 Ets binding site (bound by other Ets family members). Full-length ESE-2a was competitively blocked by both the wild type E74 and mutant E74 oligonucleotides, suggesting that these complexes are nonspecific. In contrast, the truncated ESE-2aDelta 42 protein formed a strong faster migrating protein-DNA complex, which was absent from control lysate and which was competitively blocked by the wild type E74 oligonucleotide but not by the mutant E74 oligonucleotide. ESE-2 binds to Ets sites in the promoters of several salivary gland- and prostate-specific promoters and to the SPRR2A promoter Ets site. Double-stranded oligos encoding putative Ets binding sites found in the promoters of several salivary gland- and prostrate-specific genes were generated. Relative binding affinity and specificity of the truncated form of ESE-2a for these sites was compared with the affinity for the E74 site by their ability to compete with binding of ESE-2aDelta 42 to the E74 probe. ESE-2 acts as a transactivator of the PSP promoter. Full-length ESE-2a was inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector pCI and was co-transfected into COS cells together with a pXP2 luciferase reporter gene construct containing two copies of the PSP Ets site inserted upstream of the minimal c-fos promoter Delta 56. Cotransfection with pCI ESE-2a resulted in a 7-fold activation of the PSP promoter Ets site compared with the parental pCI vector, whereas the empty pXP2 vector was not activated by ESE-2a.

The entire open reading frame of Fra-1 was fused to the DNA-binding domain (first 147 amino acids) of the yeast Gal4 protein. In addition, most of the leucine zipper region of Fra-1 was deleted to prevent dimerization and subsequent transactivation by Jun partner proteins. Equivalent fusion proteins between Gal4 and c-Fos were generated for use as controls. Expression plasmids directing the synthesis of these hybrid transcription factors were transiently transfected into NIH 3T3 cells together with a reference g-globin gene and the Gal4-responsive reporter gene pfos-4. S1 nuclease analysis showed that full-length Gal4 and both c-Fos fusion proteins strongly stimulated transcription of a Gal4-responsive fos reporter gene. However, both Fra-1 fusion proteins, Gal4�Fra-1 and Gal4�Fra-1-Dzip, were unable to activate Gal4-dependent transcription, as was the polypeptide Gal4 consisting of only the DNA-binding domain. Failed synthesis or instability of the Gal4�Fra-1 proteins was ruled out: all three proteins, were efficiently expressed in transiently transfected COS-7 cells, as shown by the EMSA analysis, expression of the Gal4�Fra-1 fusion proteins efficiently interfered with transactivation by the full-length Gal4 protein in competition experiments, in contrast to the situation observed with the hybrid Gal4-cFos transcription factors.

Sp1 DNA-binding activity was tested in parallel as a control of the efficiency of nuclear protein extraction in the different cell extracts. Higher protein binding to TRE was detected in MCF7-Fra-1 cells in the absence of doxycycline than in the presence of doxycycline or in the parental MCF7t cells. In addition, AP-1-mediated transcription, measured by transient transfection of reporter constructs containing four AP-1-binding sites, was increased by about threefold.Inhibition of Fra-1 expression in the ER- MDA-MB231 cell line. Fra-1 expression was specifically inhibited in ER- breast cancer cells by RNA interference. The Fra-1 signal level was decreased by more than 98% in cells transfected by Fra-1-specific siRNA compared to control. C-fos expression, which was not modulated by Fra-1 overexpression in MCF7 cells, was weakly but reproducibly reduced by Fra-1 siRNA. Actin and Fra-2 content was unaffected, thus demonstrating the specificity of the silencing and the lack of general toxicity on the cells. Fra-1 extinction in MDA-MB231 cells decreased binding to the AP-1-specific DNA sequence and led to a fivefold inhibition of AP-1-mediated transcription. Moreover, Fra-1 siRNA rapidly changed the morphological appearance of the cells.

Members of this subclass are characterized as transcription factors which bind DNA through zinc finger motifs. These motifs contain conserved H-C links. Gli family zinc finger proteins are mediators of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling and they are implicated as potent oncogenes in the embryonal carcinoma cell. The protein encoded by this gene localizes to the cytoplasm and activates patched Drosophila homolog (PTCH) gene expression."From OMIM: "Sequencing of GLI cDNA clones showed the presence of 5 tandem zinc fingers connected by histidine-cysteine links, which indicated that the gene belongs to the family of zinc finger genes related to Kruppel (Kr). The Drosophila gene Kr is a member of the gap class of segmentation genes; thoracic and anterior abdominal segments fail to form in Kr mutant embryos. This suggested to Ruppert et al. (1988) that other genes of this class might prove important in normal or disease states. Indeed, other genes important in neoplasia, such as NMYC (164840), LMYC (164850), HER2 (164870), and NRAS (164790), have been identified partly by their homology to previously identified oncogenes. Therefore, Ruppert et al. (1988) used a GLI cDNA fragment encoding the zinc finger region to isolate related human sequences. Six distinct loci were identified in this manner.

A full-length Goosecoid protein was synthesized by in vitro transcription and translation of clone cDNA-E and verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gel shift assays were performed with different templates. Specific binding was obvious in reactions using the consensus sequence (TAATCCGATTA). Binding was abolished upon addition of 100-fold excess of nonradioactive template. The specificity of this binding was confirmed by the lack of mobility shift using a mutated binding site (mDE) as template. In addition, binding to the consensus site, PE, and DE could not be competed by the addition of 100-fold molar excess of non-labeled mDE. These experiments demonstrate that in vitro a full-length mouse Goosecoid protein can bind to the two palindromic prd type elements present in its own promoter.Goosecoid acts as a repressor of its own transcription in mouse P19 cells. A series of reporter constructs containing the promoter regions for human and mouse goosecoid cloned in front of the minimal promoter of the thymidine kinase gene linked to the firefly luciferase reporter gene were generated. Transient co-transfection experiments of luciferase reporter gene constructs and goosecoid cDNA-E under the control of the CMV promoter (pRC/CMV-cDNA-E) were performed. Long promoter fragments of mouse and human goosecoid conferred reporter gene activity in P19 cells, which was repressed by mouse (mgsc) and Xenopus (Xgsc) goosecoid. Mutated versions of Xgsc and mgsc showed reduced or no repression. The homeobox gene mix-1 did not repress the long human reporter. The basal activity of the empty luciferase vector pT81LUC was not affected by co-transfection of mouse goosecoid. Short promoter fragments of mouse (142 bp) and human (139 bp): goosecoid conferred reporter gene activity in P19 cells, which was repressed by mouse Goosecoid. Repression was not affected by a mutation of DE (mDE), whereas a mutated PE (mPE) abolished repression. A double mutant of DE and PE resulted in loss of reporter activity.

Using a series of P1/2 site probes and recombinant Gsc homeodomain purified from bacteria, the authors performed gel shift experiments to define the preferred Gsc half-site. Gsc bound almost exclusively to the P1/2C probe. They also tested the ability of Gsc to bind the panel of idealized P3 sites as well. Consistent with its half-site preference, Gsc preferentially bound the P3C element as a cooperative dimer. Gsc interacts with a restricted range of P3 sites, exhibits lower cooperativity, but has a higher affinity for the P1/2C site relative to Alx4. DNA binding properties of Alx4/Gsc heterodimers was studied using four idealized P-elements as probes. Because the Alx4 peptide is larger than the Gsc peptide, heterodimers can be recognized by the appearance of a complex with intermediate mobility. Heterodimers could be detected on all sites tested, but formed preferentially on P3C. The cooperativity constant for heterodimeric binding on the P3C site was greater than that of Gsc homodimer formation; as a consequence, the heterodimer was the preferred species on this site. The failure of Alx4 and Gsc to be co-immunoprecipitated (data not shown) strongly suggests that heterodimerization is dependent on the presence of a DNA binding site.Gsc preferentially antagonized Alx4-mediated activation of the P3C-CAT reporter, as shown by a 20-fold decrease in activity at the lowest dose of pCMX-Gsc tested. Likewise, reporter genes containing sites that support weak heterodimer formation are not efficiently antagonized by Gsc. The ability of Gsc to antagonize Alx4 was dependent on the eh-1 domain (data not shown), indicating that this represented active repression and not a simple competition for sites.

Using mammalian one-hybrid analysis, HAND2 contains a strong transcriptional activation domain in the amino-terminal third of the protein. HAND2 heterodimerizes with the broadly expressed bHLH factors, the E-proteins. The consensus DNA binding site of HAND2 was determined using an in vitro selection/amplification assay, which showed that HAND2 binds a subset of E-boxes as a heterodimer with E12. However, transactivation of ANP appears to be DNA-binding independent.	11812799	TF PPI; Transactivation	Mouse	Strong	HAND2 contains a strong activation domain located in the amino-terminal region. HAND2 was fused with the yeast Gal4 minimal DNA binding domain to create a chimeric transcription factor dependent on HAND2 for transcriptional activation but not DNA binding. The Gal4-HAND2 fusion plasmid and a luciferase reporter plasmid containing five Gal4 DNA binding sites upstream of the E1b basal promoter were co-transfected into COS-7 cells. The authors also generated a series of HAND2 deletions fused to Gal4-DBD and tested their ability to activate transcription by transient co-transfection with the 5E1b-Luc reporter construct. Full-length HAND2 does not significantly activate transcription. The construct containing the bHLH plus the carboxyl portion of HAND2 (encoding AA 86-217) activates transcription to slightly higher level than the full-length HAND2 protein. The Gal4 fusion construct containing only the amino-terminal region of HAND2 (encoding AA 1-85) activates transcription 47-fold higher than the full-length HAND2 protein. The high activity associated with the amino-terminal domain and low activity observed for the full-length protein suggest that HAND2 function is regulated by intra- or intermolecular interactions that mask full transcriptional activity. Further deletion experiments suggested that a core activation domain is situated between amino acids 41-85.Yeast two-hybrid analysis of a neuro-2a neuroblastoma cell library for HAND2-interacting proteins showed that members of the E-protein family were the most highly represented class of HAND2-interacting proteins. Our screen confirmed that HAND2 forms homodimers, because HAND2 represented 14% of the clones isolated.  Results suggest that whereas HAND2 can form homodimers in vitro and in yeast, in mammalian cells the functional complex is preferentially a heterodimer with E-proteinsHigh affinity binding sites were identified by an invitro selection and amplification experiment using an equimolar mixture of Hand2 and E12 protein and by competitive gel mobility shift assay.In vitro results indicate that HAND2 binds to a distinct set of E-boxes as a heterodimer with E12. A HAND2 E-box-dependent CAT reporter carrying four copies of the HAND2 E-box site upstream of a thymidine kinase basal promoter was generated. Transient co-transfection of this reporter with a HAND2 expression construct in NIH3T3 cells enhanced transcription 17-fold relative to reporter alone. Because the transcriptional activation domain located in the amino third of HAND2 is masked in the context of the whole protein, the authors determined whether E12 is able to unmask this domain through dimerization. When HAND2 and E12 were co-transfected, the level of transcriptional activity was additive. E12 also activates transcription through this site but to a lesser extent than HAND2 . Because the addition of E12 did not increase transcription to the same extent observed with the amino terminus of HAND2 alone, our results suggest that E12 interaction with HAND2 alone cannot unmask the transcriptional activation domain of HAND2. To examine HAND2 function in the context of a different promoter, HAND2 regulation of transcription via six copies of the E-box upstream of a TATA box derived from the alpha -myosin heavy chain minimal promoter was examined. A fixed concentration of reporter was co-transfected with increasing concentrations of HAND2 expression vector. The level of transcriptional activity increased in proportion to the amount of HAND2 vector transfected with a maximum at ~1.6 �g of DNA/60-mm plate.

Transcriptional properties were assayed in 293 cells.  Cotransfection with E12, HAND1 or both had no significant effect on ANP transcription as assayed by luciferase activity. In contrast, cotrnsfection of HAND2 with -3.6ANPpGL2 resulted in robust transactivation. Moreover, cotransfection of HAND2 and E12 shows further enhancement of transcriptional activity than HAND2 alone. ANP regulation by HAND2 is independent of DNA binding. Surprisingly, extensive gel shift analysis failed to show direct DNA binding of HAND2/E12 to any of the Ebox sequences identified by sequence analysis. Disruption of three Ebox elements by point mutations and the use of a mutant HAND2 lacking a DNA binding domain still resulted in transactivation of ANP.

Pull down assays shows that SMRT and N-CoR complexes bind to GST-TR, along with HDAC3 in the complexes, but not HDAC3 alone. In Xenopus oocytes, microinjection of anti-HDAC3 and anti-N-CoR Abs partially relieves repression.

THAP7 coimmunoprecipitates with NCoR in 293T cell nuclear lysates, and when NCoR protein expression is reduced with siRNA, repression is reduced.

Also, Hmgb1 binds SREBP-1 in-vivo as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. As well, Hmgb1 increases the binding intensity of SREBP-1 to the Sterol Regulatory Element (SRE) as demonstrated by mobility shift and supershift assays, but does not change the mobility of the SREBP-1-SRE complex. This suggests that although it does interact with SREBP-1 and affects transcription, it is not directly involved in the protein-DNA interaction.	16040616	Co-activation; Other	Human; Mouse	Strong	In a cotransfection assay, in which a mouse expression vector for either SREBP-1 or SREBP-2 was transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells along with a reporter vector (Sterol regulatory element (SRE) fused to Luciferase), reporter expression increased five-fold relative to expression vector alone.

When GST-tagged mouse Hmgb1 was added to the mobility shift and supershift reactions, the intensities of the shifted bands increased in a dose-dependent fashion. However, the presence of Hmgb1 did not change the mobility of the shifted band in either assay.

HMGA1 associates with the ETS factor PU.1, resulting in changes in PU.1 structure, and enhanced transcriptional synergy with Ets-1 on the mu enhancer in nonlymphoid cells. New data show HMGA1 directly interacts with Ets-1 in addition to PU.1. In vitro HMGA1/Ets-1 interaction facilitates Ets-1/mu enhancer binding in the absence of an HMGA1.Ets-1.DNA complex. To address whether HMGA1 is present in the transcriptionally active mu nucleoprotein complex, we completed DNA pull-down assays to detect protein tethering in the context of protein/DNA interaction. Results show that HMGA1 is not tightly associated with mu enhancer DNA through PU.1 or Ets-1, despite strong associations between these proteins in solution. However, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show HMGA1 associates with the endogenous enhancer in B cells. Furthermore, antisense HMGA1 substantially decreases mu enhancer activity in B cells. Taken together, these data suggest that HMGA1 functions as a transcriptional mu enhancer co-activator in B cells through indirect association with DNA.Experimental methods include EMSA and ChIP.

The hepatocyte nuclear factors are transcriptional activators for liver-specific transcripts such as albumin and transthyretin. The HNF3 family, including HNF3A, HNF3B, and HNF3G are members of the forkhead class of DNA-binding proteins.The transcription factors Hnf3a and Gata4 are the earliest known to bind the albumin gene enhancer in liver precursor cells in mouse embryos. To determine how they access sites in silent chromatin, Cirillo et al. (2002) assembled nucleosome arrays containing albumin enhancer sequences and compacted them with linker histone. Hnf3a and Gata4, but not human NF1, mouse Cebp-beta, or yeast GAL4-AH, bound their sites in compacted chromatin and opened the local nucleosomal domain in the absence of ATP-dependent enzymes. The authors showed that the ability of Hnf3a to open chromatin is mediated by a high-affinity DNA-binding site and by the C-terminal domain of the protein, which binds histones H3 and H4. They concluded that factors that potentiate transcription in development are inherently capable of initiating chromatin opening events.	2227418	DNA Binding	Rat	Strong	HNF-3 is a site found to be important in the maximal hepatocyte-specific expression of several genes. Authors find that liver nuclear extracts contain three major binding activities for this site, which they call HNF-3A, HNF-3B, and HNF-3C. Purification from rat liver nuclear extracts of HNF-3A and HNF-3C reveals that each activity corresponds to a distinct polypeptide. Peptide sequence derived from the most abundant species, HNF-3A, was used for synthesizing probes with which to isolate a cDNA clone of this protein. The encoded protein contains 466 amino acids (48.7 kD) and has binding properties identical to those of the purified protein. A 160-amino-acid region that does not resemble the binding domain of any known transcription factor is essential for DNA binding. The mRNA for HNF-3A is present in the rat liver but not in brain, kidney, intestine, or spleen, and the basis for this difference is cell-specific regulation of HNF-3A gene transcription.

To understand how they access sites in silent chromatin, Authors assembled nucleosome arrays containing albumin enhancer sequences and compacted them with linker histone. HNF3 and GATA-4, but not NF-1, C/EBP, and GAL4-AH, bound their sites in compacted chromatin and opened the local nucleosomal domain in the absence of ATP-dependent enzymes. The ability of HNF3 to open chromatin is mediated by a high affinity DNA binding site and by the C-terminal domain of the protein, which binds histones H3 and H4. Thus, factors that potentiate transcription in development are inherently capable of initiating chromatin opening events.

This was demonstrated by EMSA. Recombinant GST-hnRNP K stimulated transcription most effectivly from templates bearing single-stranded tails composed of the pyrimidine strand of the CT element but not mutant tails. Although the amino terminus of hnRNP K possesses transactivator function, as demonstrated in transfectionexperiments with a series of hnRNP K deletion mutants or with chimeras fusing segments of hnRNP K to the DNA binding domain of Gal-4, no portion of hnRNP K supported the dramatic transcriptional regulation typical of stronger transactivators such as Gal-4 or adenovirus E1a proteins. hnRNP K interacts with the basal transcription apparatus, shown by affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation. Transiently transfected TBP and hnRNP K costimulate CTelement transcription in vivo, as shown using a CT element-driven CAT reporter in HeLa cells.

Competition assays using HBS-I and HBS-II sequences, wild-type and containing mutations in the TAAT core, revealed that binding was specific to HBS-I. Additional support was obtained using three tandem copies of the N-CAM HBS-I motif in EMSA. Cotransfection of CMV-HoxC6 (long and short variants) in NIH 3T3 cells together with the mouse N-CAM promoter/CAT gene reporter plasmid induced CAT reporter gene expression driven by the N-CAM promoter (~7-fold individually and 11.5-fold when both variants were cotransfected). Reporters containing wild-type and mutant HBS-I and HBS-II sequences were also tested for transactivation activity by HoxC6 to a SV40 minimal promoter in cotransfection experiments. The long variant of HoxC6 strongly activated transcription via the HBS-I and HBS-II regions but not from the mutated regions.

To study the functional properties of both HOXC6 proteins in breast cancer cells, co-transfection experiments with pTCBS as reporter plasmid in MDA-MB231 cells, which do not express detectable levels of HOXC6, were designed. The construct contains a multimerized consensus binding sequence (CBS) that can mediate trans-activation of multiple HOX-derived proteins.  As a positive control for the transfections, HOXD9 gene product, which trans-activates pTCBS in NIH3T3 cells as well as in MDA-MB231 cells was used. Both HOXC6 gene products repress the transcription from the CBS in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, when co-transfected with HOXB7 gene product, which causes a trans-activation by itself, the 173 or 211 pcDNA3 constructs significantly suppressed the induced expression of the luciferase gene in a dose-dependent manner. The results suggest that both HOXC6 products harbour intrinsic repressing abilities and can co-operate with other HOX-derived proteins on the CBS.

Transactivation activity was confirmed by luciferase assay in HMEC stably expressing Hox D3. Hox D3 was also shown to promote beta5 expression in vivo.		   14610084  DNA Binding; Transactivation   Human      Strong	   The role of Hox D3 in the regulation of integrin alpha5 beta1 expression was examined. HMEC-1 endothelial cells were stably transfected with pCMV-D3, a Hox D3 expression vector, leading to enhanced Hox D3 expression. Integrin alpha5 mRNA and protein levels were significantly up-regulated by expression of Hox D3 (pCMV-D3) in microvascular endothelial cells in vitro. Conversely, expression of HOX D3 antisense inhibits HOX D3, but not HOX B3 or HOX A3, gene expression as well as alpha5 mRNA expression. Hox D3 had no effect on expression of the 1 integrin subunit. These studies indicate that the transcription factor Hox D3 promotes integrin alpha5 message and protein expression. Direct binding of Hox D3 to the integrin alpha5 and beta3 integrin promoters were confirmed by chromatin cross-linking and immunoprecipitation studies in HMEC stably expressing an HA/Hox D3 expression plasmid. Antibodies against the paralogous Hox B3, which does not affect alpha5 beta3 expression, did not recover the beta 2 integrin promoter.As Hox D3 directly binds to the integrin subunit promoters and also induces their up-regulation in endothelial cells, Hox D3 is likely to directly regulate the expression of these integrins by binding to their promoters and initiating transcription. To test this possibility, a luciferase expression construct under control of the integrin beta 3 promoter was transfected into HMEC stably expressing Hox D3. Transcriptional activation of the beta3 promoter was significantly higher in Hox D3-expressing HMEC as compared with control HMEC. Mutation of two putative Hox-binding sites within the beta3 promoter resulted in the loss of Hox D3-dependent transcriptional activity. In contrast, activity of the MMP-14 promoter was similar in both control and Hox D3-expressing HMEC.To determine whether Hox D3 regulates integrin alpha5 beta1 expression in vivo, chick chorioallantoic membranes stimulated with saline, Del-1, or bFGF were transfected with Hox D3 sense or antisense constructs. Application of either bFGF or Del-1 to CAMs stimulates angiogenesis and induces alpha5 beta1 expression. Integrin alphav beta5 expression remains unchanged upon treatment with bFGF or Del-1, however. Hox D3 antisense suppresses 5 expression in vivo. Expression of Hox D3 antisense suppresses chicken Hox D3 but not chicken Hox B3, indicating that the human Hox D3 antisense construct suppresses chicken Hox D3 expression and thereby integrin expression. These results indicate that Hox D3 regulates integrin 5 expression in vitro and in vivo.

Because IRF9 istargeted to the nucleus in the absence of IFN stimulation, the potential of IRF9protein for gene regulation was examined using a GAL4 DNA binding domain fusionsystem. GAL4-IRF9 was transcriptionally active in reporter gene assays but not inthe absence of cellular STAT1 and STAT2. However, the inert IRF9 protein wasreadily converted to a constitutively active ISGF3-like activator by fusion withthe C-terminal transcriptional activation domain of STAT2 or the acidicactivation domain of herpesvirus VP16. The IRF9 hybrids are targeted toendogenous ISGF3 target loci and can activate their transcription. Moreover,expression of the IRF9-STAT2 fusion can recapitulate the type I IFN biologicalresponse, producing a cellular antiviral state that protects cells fromvirus-induced cytopathic effects and inhibits virus replication. The antiviralstate generated by regulated IRF9-STAT2 hybrid protein expression is independentof autocrine IFN signaling and inhibits both RNA and DNA viruses.

The binding site was identified using deletion constructs in transient tranfections assays combined with EMSA assays. Transactivation of Bax1 was enhanced in the presence of Pax1 and Pax9.	15024065	Co-activation; DNA Binding; TF PPI; Transactivation	Mouse	Strong	The plasmid p5.3Bp-luc, which contained a fragment of about 5.5 kb of the mouse Bapx1 promoter followed by the luciferase reporter gene was used in transient transfection assays to determine if Meox genes maintain Bapx1 expression by direct activation of its transcription. This construct has previously been shown to be transactivated by Pax1 and Pax9. p5.3Bp-luc was cotransfected with increasing amounts of the Meox1 expression vector pMeox1 in NIH 3T3 cells. pMeox1 induced a dose-dependent activation of the Bapx1 promoter, up to fourfold. This transactivation effect of Meox1 was specific for Bapx1 regulatory sequences, as Meox1 did not activate the control vector pGL3-Basic or pGL3-Promoter, a reporter vector containing an SV40 promoter upstream of the luciferase gene.The Meox1 and Pax1 proteins can interact in the yeast two-hybrid system as well as in a pulldown assay (22). Sclerotomal transcription factors Pax1 and Pax9 can transactivate the Bapx1 promoter (21). In transient transfection assays, Pax1 alone increased Bapx1 promoter activity around threefold. Cotransfection of the p5.3Bp-luc plasmid with increasing amounts of the Meox1 expression vector together with the Pax1 expression vector further stimulated the promoter activity eightfold over the basal level.  Maximal Bapx1 promoter activity was achieved in the presence of the three factors Pax1, Pax9, and Meox1.Transient transfection assays with a series of deletion constructs of the Bapx1 promoter were performed to identify Bapx1 binding sites. Meox1-responsive element(s) were located between positions -880 and +109 of the Bapx1 gene. EMSA confirmed that in vitro-synthesized Meox1 protein formed a retarded complex with DNA fragment C in this region. Further EMSA experiments were performed using oligonucleotides based on conserved sequences containing predicted binding sites. When these labeled oligonucleotides were incubated with Meox1 protein, a specific retarded complex was observed only with the B5 oligonucleotide. The specificity of this complex was further confirmed by the addition of an anti-Meox1 antibody to the binding reaction, which induced the formation of a supershifted band together with a strong decrease in the intensity of the Meox1-B5 retarded complex. Competitive binding assays identified a TAATTA sequence to which Meox1 binds. Regulation via this sequence was confirmed by luciferase assay.

(2001) investigated 5 missense mutations of the FOXC1 transcription factor found in patients with Axenfeld-Rieger malformations to determine their effects on FOXC1 structure and function. Molecular modeling of the FOXC1 forkhead domain predicted that the missense mutations did not alter FOXC1 structure. Biochemical analyses indicated that whereas all mutant proteins correctly localized to the cell nucleus, the I87M (601090.0009) mutation reduced FOXC1 protein levels. DNA-binding experiments revealed that although the S82T (601090.0008) and S131L (601090.0002) mutations decreased DNA binding, the F112S (601090.0004) and I126M (601090.0003) mutations did not. However, the F112S and I126M mutations decreased the transactivation ability of FOXC1. All the FOXC1 mutations had the net effect of reducing FOXC1 transactivation ability. These results indicated that the FOXC1 forkhead domain contains separable DNA-binding and transactivation functions. In addition, these findings demonstrated that reduced stability, DNA binding, or transactivation, all causing a decrease in the ability of FOXC1 to transactivate genes, can underlie Axenfeld-Rieger malformations. Saleem et al. (2003) studied an additional 5 missense mutations in the FOXC1 gene. Biologic analyses indicated that all missense mutations studied caused various FOXC1 perturbations, including nuclear localization defects, reduced or abolished DNA binding capacity, and a reduction in the transactivation capacity of FOXC1. 30 PubMed Neighbors

Wild-type MAT1, as well as RING finger domain mutants MAT1-C9Y, MAT1-C26S and MAT1[66-309] were retained by TFIIH factors, while mutant MAT1[1-189] was not. In an in-vitro transcription assay, in which TFIIH complex components were incubated with RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II), basal transcription factors, MAT1, either the adenovirus 2 major late promoter or the DHFR promoter as templates, and NTPs, the presence of wild-type (wt) MAT1 led to 8-10 fold increased transcription from both promoters while MAT1 RING finger domain mutants (MAT1[66-309], MAT1-C9Y and MAT1-C26S) did not stimulate transcription.

Artificial fusion protein shown to bind a target sequence in vitro (EMSA).	9368026	Transactivation	Mouse	Strong	Evidence for sequence specific binding and role in regulating expression.Quoting from the abstract: "We identified the Osteocalcin (OC)  gene as a target for transcriptional suppression by Msx2, a homeodomain transcription factor that controls ossification in the developing skull. In this study, we examine the effects of Msx2 expression on OC promoter activation (luciferase reporter) by FGF2/FSK and calcitriol in MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. Expression of Msx2 decreases basal activity of the 1-kilobase (-1050 to +32) rat OC promoter by 80%; however, the promoter is still inducible 3-fold by calcitriol. By contrast, OC promoter induction by FGF2/FSK is completely abrogated by Msx2. Because intrinsic Msx2 DNA binding activity is not required for the Msx2 suppressor function, we assessed whether Msx2 represses OC activation by regulating DNA-protein interactions at the FGF2 response element (OCFRE) and compared these interactions with those occurring at the calcitriol response element (VDRE). Treatment of MC3T3-E1 cells with FGF2/FSK or calcitriol up-regulates specific DNA-protein interactions at the OCFRE or VDRE, respectively, as detected by gel shift assay. Preincubation of crude nuclear extracts with recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Msx2 dose-dependently inhibits OCFRE DNA binding activity, whereas GST has no effect. Msx2 itself does not bind the OCFRE. Residues 132-148 required for Msx2 core suppressor function in transfection assays are also required to inhibit OCFRE DNA binding activity. By contrast, GST-Msx2 has no effect on calcitriol-regulated DNA-protein interactions at the VDRE. Using gel shift as an assay, the OCFRE DNA-binding protein OCFREB was purified to about 50% homogeneity from MG63 osteosarcoma cells. Recombinant Msx2 inhibits purified OCFREB DNA binding activity, whereas the Msx2 variant lacking residues 132-148 is inactive. Thus, Msx2 abrogates up-regulation of the OC promoter by FGF2/FSK in part by inhibiting OCFREB binding to the OCFRE."

Msx2 expression patterns in limb development strongly suggest an important role for Msx2 in the AER. Our previous studies identified a 348-bp fragment of the chicken Msx2 gene with AER enhancer activity. In this study, the functions of four potential homeodomain binding TAAT sites in this enhancer were studied using transgenic mice and in vitro protein-DNA interactions. Transgenic studies indicate that the four TAAT sites are not redundant and that only the B-TAAT site is critical for AER enhancer activity. The expression patterns of Msx2 and Dlx5 genes in the AER suggest that they might be involved in the regulation of Msx2. In support of this hypothesis, we found that Msx2 and Dlx5 can bind to the B-TAAT site as well as to a fragment containing the D- and E-TAAT sites in the Msx2 AER enhancer sequences."

Far western analysis revealed interactions of MSX2 with TFIIF, a component of the basal transcriptional machinery.  DNA binding via the homeobox domain and helix 3 was shown by gel shift; however, direct binding is not required for suppression. Furthermore, Dlx5 reverses Msx2 repression via protein-protein interactions.  9265625  Co-activation; TF PPI	  Mouse	   Medium   Systematic structure-function analyses of Msx2 was performed using OC promoter suppression (luciferase reporter) in MC3T3-E1 calvarial osteoblasts as an assay. Functional analyses of N- and C-terminally truncated molecules identify Msx2 residues 97-208 as the core suppressor domain. A Msx2 point mutant Msx2(T147A) that completely lacks DNA binding activity is indistinguishable from wild-type Msx2 in its ability to suppress the OC promoter, demonstrating that direct interaction with DNA is not required for Msx2 suppressor function. This suggests that Msx2 suppresses transcription via protein-protein interactions with components of the basal transcriptional machinery, either alone or in concert with co-regulators. Msx2 binds both components of TFIIF (RAP74, RAP30), but not TFIIB or TBP, identified via interaction "Far Western" blotting assays.

However, Dlx5 completely reverses Msx2 repression of the OC promoter. Structure- function analyses using far-Western blot and transient cotransfection assays reveal that (i) Msx2 and Dlx5 can form dimers, (ii) Dlx5 residues 127-143 are necessary for dimerization and to reverse Msx2-dependent OC repression, and (iii) intrinsic DNA binding activity of Dlx5 is not required for OC regulation. Msx2 inhibits the DNA binding activity of a third complex, OCFREB, that supports activity of the basal OC promoter. Dlx5 completely abrogates Msx2 suppression of OCFREB DNA binding activity, and residues required for Dlx5 transcriptional de-repression in vivo are also required for reversing inhibition of OCFREB binding in vitro.

The MRF proteins contain a conserved basic DNA-binding domain essential for sequence-specific DNA binding and a helix-loop-helix motif required for heterodimerization. Each of the MRFs has been shown to heterodimerize in vitro and in vivo with E proteins and to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner at sites known as E-boxes (CANNTG). This DNA motif is present in the promoters of many skeletal muscle-specific genes and mediates gene activation in an MRF-dependent manner. Several studies have identified specific enhancer elements for MyoD and myogenin. Induction of the myogenin gene has been shown to be dependent on an E-box and a myocyte enhancer factor-2 element for proper expression in the somites and limbs of the developing mouse, suggesting that its expression is MRF-dependent, in part.	10733231	DNA Binding	Human	Strong	Review assessing what is known on The molecular regulation of myogenesis in 2000

The consensus DNA-binding domain of the Myt1 family is Cys-X4-Cys-X4-His-X7-His-X5-Cys (also termed CCHHC domains).  Myt1-Like (Myt1L/neural zinc finger(NZF)-1/Png-1) has been shown to bind to DNA is a sequence-specific manner by competitive EMSA. Transactivation has also been shown by luciferase reporter assays.	8631881	DNA Binding; Transactivation	Rat	Strong	The primary amino acid sequence of the NZF-1 protein (Myt1l) suggested that the protein would contain two clusters of zinc fingers capable of serving as independent DNA binding domains. Competitive EMSA using bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase fusion protins demonstrated that specific binding of NZF-1 to the beta-RARE DNA element requires a minimum of two zinc fingers. Mutations altering this element revealed that the GAAAGTT motif is critical for binding by two zinc fingers.NZF-1 also contains regions such as acidic and serine/threonine-rich sequences commonly found in the the activation domains of many transcription factors. The potential transcriptional effects of NZF-1 were examined in CV-1 and HeLa cells, which do not contain detectable NZF-1 mRNA by RNase protection assay. NZF-1 has been shown to bind beta-RARE and Pit-1 enhancer elements in a sequence specific manner. Cotransfection of NSF-1 (under the control of the RSV promoter) and hRAR-beta promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid showed that NZF-1 moderately activated the hRAR-beta promoter ~3-fold. Cotransfection with a Pit-1 enhancer luciferase reporter in HeLa cells showed that NZF-1 activated the reporter 4-fold.

[...] In this report, we show that epidermal growth factor (EGF) increases androgen-dependent AR transactivation in the recurrent prostate cancer cell line CWR-R1 through a mechanism that involves a post-transcriptional increase in the p160 coactivator transcriptional intermediary factor 2/glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 1 (TIF2/GRIP1)  [aka NCOa2]. Site-specific mutagenesis and selective MAPK inhibitors linked the EGF-induced increase in AR transactivation to phosphorylation of TIF2/GRIP1. EGF signaling increased the coimmunoprecipitation of TIF2 and AR. AR transactivation and its stimulation by EGF were reduced by small interfering RNA inhibition of TIF2/GRIP1 expression. The data indicate that EGF signaling through MAPK increases TIF2/GRIP1 coactivation of AR transactivation in recurrent prostate cancer.

To quantify their roles in the function of androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity in vivo, we generated a unique transgenic AR-reporter mouse and analyzed the cell-specific contributions of SRC-1 and TIF2 to the activity of AR in mouse testis. Transgenic AR-luciferase and transgenic AR-lacZ mice harbor a recombinant mouse AR gene, AR(GAL4DBD), which is functionally coupled with a upstream activation sequence-mediated reporter gene (AR activity indicator). After characterization of these mice in terms of AR function, we further derived bigenic mice by crossing AR activity indicator mice with the SRC-1-/- or TIF2+/- mutant mice. Analyses of the resultant bigenic mice by in vivo imaging and luciferase assays showed that testicular AR activity was decreased significantly in those with the TIF2+/- mutation but not in the SRC-1+/- background, suggesting that TIF2 serves as the preferential coactivator for AR in testis. Immunohistological analysis confirmed that AR and TIF2 coexist in mouse testicular Sertoli cell nuclei under normal conditions. Although SRC-1 concentrates in Sertoli cell nuclei in the absence of TIF2, nuclear SRC-1 is not able to rescue AR activity in the TIF2 mutant background. Interestingly, SRC-1 appears to negatively influence AR activity, thereby counterbalancing the TIF2-stimulated AR activity. Our results provide unique in vivo insights to the multidimensional cell-type-specific interactions between AR and coregulators.

The C-terminal domain of NDRF is the activation domain, as demonstrated by deletion analysis and luciferase reporter gene experiments.	  8816493    DNA Binding; Transactivation Human	      Medium	      Expression vectors driving the human neuroD1 and neuroD2 coding regions from a simian cytomegalovirus promoter, pCS2-hND1 and pCS2-hND2 were constructed, and the activity of neuroD1 and neuroD2 on reporter constructs cotransfected into P19 cells was assayed. Other member of the neuroD family have been shown to bind to consensus E-box sequences in vitro. In vitro gel shift assays demonstrated that NeuroD1 and neuroD2 can bind to an oligonucleotide containing the core E-box CACCTG as a heterodimer with an E-protein (not shown here). The authors tested the ability of NeuroD1/2 to activate transcription of a simple reporter construct composed of multimerized E-box with the same core sequence and the minimal promoter from the thymidine kinase gene driving the luciferase gene, p4RTKluc. Transfection of either pCS2-hND1 or pCS2-hND2 modestly increased the level of activity from p4RTK-luc in P19 cells, increasing the activity between two- and fourfold. Additional reporter constructs were tested in P19 cells to determine whether neuroD1 and neuroD2 had different transcriptional activation potentials. The ability of pCS2-hND1 and pCS2-hND2 to transactivate a luciferase reporter construct driven by a 760-bp core promoter of the GAP-43 gene (pGAP43-luciferase), a neuron-specific promoter construct which is upregulated in vivo in postmitotic, terminally differentiating neurons was tested. In contrast to the simple E-box driven reporter, pCS2-hND1 did not show significant transactivation of the pGAP43-luciferase, while pCS2-hND2 induced expression from this construct by approximately fourfold over the basal activity.

NeuroD-like factors were detected in box-I-related nucleoprotein complexes formed by brain nuclear extract (EMSA and western blotting for NeuroD-like proteins). To confirm that NDRF binds to the box-I element of the IP3R1 gene, EMSA using recombinant NDRF protein was performed. E47 itself bound the box-I sequence weakly; NDRF alone did not bind stably to box-I; but NDRF markedly enhances the DNA-binding of E47 through heterodimerization. Mutation of the E-box sequence in box-I descreased binding affinity of NDRF/E47. Activation function of NDRF was assayed using cotransfection experiments in PC12h cells, which express low but significant levels of IP3R1. The reporter plasmid contained the luceriferase gene under the control of the IP3R1 promoter. Cotranfection with NDRF resulted in ~5-fold activation.

Consistent with previous reports, competitive EMSA showed that E47 bound the box-I sequence weakly. Addition of NDRF markedly enhanced specific DNA-binding of E47, whereas NDRF alone did not bind the probe DNA.To investigate the role of C-AD in E-box-directed transcriptional activation, luciferase reporter gene assay were performed. PC12 cells were transfected with an expression vector producing wild-type NDRF (1�383) or its C-AD-truncated version (1�315). The IP3R1 promoter was stimulated ~5-fold by co-transfection of the wild-type NDRF, while it was activated only 2-fold by the C-AD-truncated NDRF. Since NDRF enhanced DNA-binding ability of E47, we examined the effects of the transcriptional activation function of class A proteins using a mutant E47 (473�651) that lacks its activation domain(s). Transcriptional activation functions of both wild-type and mutant NDRF were repressed by co-expression of E47 (473�651), while no repression was observed by co-expression of wild-type E47 (1�651).

Upon lowering the concentration of nonspecific competitor poly(dI-dC), NFATc3 binding was observed and the gel shift could be eliminated by adding unlabeled IL-2 NFAT site competitive inhibitor. The observed gel shift  was also eliminated by adding excess unlabeled AP probe, indicating that NFATc3 may bind to this DNA site in complex with AP1-related proteins. The concentration of nonspecific competitor used to demonstrate NFATc3 binding to the IL-2 NFAT site in COS extracts overexpressing NFATc3 was significantly lower than that required to obtain specific binding of the endogenous NFAT complex to this site in primary cell extracts. Thus, the IL-2 NFAT site most likely does not represent a physiologic DNA binding site for NFATc3.

Direct binding to a ATTACGTCTG consensus sequence was shown using EMSA and DNase footprinting.       7565758	    DNA Binding; Transactivation   Human	      Medium	 To define the transcriptional regulatory activity of NF-IL3A on the IL-3 promoter, transient transfections into MLA144 cells were performed. Introduction of the NF-IL3A BC12 expression plasmid into resting MLA144 T cells increased the CAT activity generated by the -315 and -173 plasmids 5.2- and 5.0-fold, respectively, compared with that generated by the BC12 expression vector alone. No significant change in the promoter activity of the -61 plasmid, which lacks the A region sequences, was seen. Introduction of 3-bp substitutions into the NF-IL3A consensus binding sequence eliminated responsiveness to NF-IL3A. Similarly, cotransfection of the NF-IL3A BC12 plasmid had no effect on the enhancerless pTE2 plasmid, but it activated the pTE2 plasmid containing two copies of the A region sequences approximately fivefold. These experiments demonstrate that the GTC nucleotides in the NF-IL3A consensus binding sequence (ATTACGTCTG) in the A region are required for responsiveness to NFIL3A. Specific binding of NF-IL3A to IL-3 promoter sequences was confirmed by competitive EMSA and DNase footprinting.

The results indicate that the sequence from nt 1650 to 1662 in box alpha  was the binding site for E4BP4. This segment contains the sequence cTTACaTAAg (the lowercase letters represent the sequence which is different from the consensus E4BP4 binding sequence), which resembled the consensus E4BP4 binding sequence (A/G)T(G/T)A(T/C)GTAA(T/C) (12).The binding specificity of overexpressed E4BP4 protein was examined in HuH-7 cells in transient-transfection assays. Total cell lysates from untransfected and transfected cells were obtained for Western and gel shift experiments. Two forms of E4BP4 were detected with anti-E4BP4 antiserum in pf:E4BP4-transfected cells. Box alpha binding activity was present in both untransfected cells and cells transfected with pf:E4BP4 or empty vector. In the nuclear extracts obtained from pf:E4BP4 transfectants, a supershift of box alpha  binding activity by anti-FLAG and anti-E4BP4 antibodies was observed. This supershift was not seen with a control preimmune serum. These results indicated that E4BP4 could indeed bind to the box alpha  sequence. They also showed that E4BP4 is not a major component of endogenous box alpha binding proteins. Moreover, inclusion of unlabeled competing oligonucleotides in molar excess showed that wild-type box alpha  and the EF sequences could effectively abolish the box alpha  binding activity that was supershifted with anti-FLAG antibody. Identical results were obtained with another E4BP4-transfected differentiated human hepatoma cell line, HepG2.A single copy of the box alpha  sequence in an upstream position stimulates the transcription of the HBV basal core promoter in both HepG2 and HuH-7 cells (68). To examine the effect of E4BP4 on box alpha , a CAT reporter plasmid containing an upstream box alpha sequence was cotransfected with pf:E4BP4 or pFLAG-CMV2 vector in HepG2 and HuH-7 cells. Coexpression of E4BP4 reduced the CAT activity by 35- and 14-fold in HepG2 and HuH-7 cells, respectively. Cotransfection with pFLAG-CMV2, which had no insert, had no significant effect.

In higher eukaryotes, this element is found in about 30% of the promoters, preferentially in the -60/-100 region, and analysis of various CCAAT boxes showed that specific flanking sequences are required for efficient binding.	12401788	TF PPI	Other	Not Selected	The heterotrimeric transcription factor NF-Y recognizes with high specificity and affinity the CCAAT regulatory element that is widely represented in promoters and enhancer regions. The CCAAT box acts in concert with neighboring elements, and its bending by NF-Y is thought to be a major mechanism required for transcription activation. We have solved the structure of the NF-YC/NF-YB subcomplex of NF-Y, which shows that the core domains of both proteins interact through histone fold motifs. This histone-like pair is closely related to the H2A/H2B and NC2alpha/NC2beta families, with features that are both common to this class of proteins and unique to NF-Y. The structure together with the modeling of the nonspecific interaction of NF-YC/NF-YB with DNA and the full NF-Y/CCAAT box complex highlight important structural features that account for different and possibly similar biological functions of the transcriptional regulators NF-Y and NC2.

Pax2 activation can further be enhanced by phosphorylation, as shown by CAT reporter assays. Specific DNA-binding has been shown by EMSA.	11700324  Transactivation   Human	Medium	To assess the effects of Pax2 phosphorylation on the transactivation potential, a reporter plasmid containing five copies of the PRS4 Pax2b binding sequence upstream of a minimal promoter and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene was used. Using a fixed amount of Pax2b plasmid and increasing amounts of MEKK1, Pax2-dependent reporter activation increased dramatically with as little as 50 ng of MEKK1 expression plasmid. Pax2 transfection can stimulate the reporter plasmid activity by 8-10-fold. This increased to more than 50-fold by co-transfection of 200 ng of MEKK1 expression plasmid. In the absence of Pax2, MEKK1 had no effect on the expression of the reporter. Furthermore, a kinase-deficient MEKK1 construct showed only a slight increase at the highest doses. Pax2-dependent transactivation was also enhanced in the presence of Wnt expression plasmids. Expression of Wnt4, Wnt11, and Wnt7a all generated a 2-3-fold increase in Pax2-dependent activation of the reporter gene. Whereas Wnt gene expression alone had no effect on CAT activity in the absence of Pax2. As reported previously (3), deletion of the transactivation domain reduced Pax2-dependent activation.

A mouse BAC library was used to identify GDNF exon 1-containing fragments that were then fused to the reporter gene, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). Sequences spanning 2.4 or 4.2 kb upstream from a unique BamHI site in exon 1 were indistinguishable in their ability to activate reporter gene expression in a Pax2-dependent manner. We thus focused on the smaller construct, p2.4-CAT. Using increasing amounts of Pax2 expression vectors, p2.4-CAT was activated 20- to 30-fold in response to Pax2b and approximately 10- to 15-fold in response to Pax2a.A combination of EMSA and DNAseI footprint analyses was used to map potential Pax2-binding sites within the 2.4 kb region that demonstrated Pax2-dependent activation of the reporter. Fragments spanning the entire region were isolated and used in gel shift experiments with increasing amounts of recombinant Pax2-PD. In addition, total digests of the 2.4 kb region were subject to gel shift analysis to ascertain if specific fragments could be identified that showed an increase in electrophoretic mobility. From these initial digests at least two binding sites were identified. To map the Pax2-PD binding sequences more precisely, DNAseI footprinting was carried out using the corresponding fragments for PBS1 and PBS2. However, only the fragment corresponding to PBS2 gave a recognizable DNAseI footprint, most probably owing to better binding efficiency. A double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the DNAseI footprint of PBS2 was used in gel shift experiments to confirm binding specificity. Within the fragment spanning PBS1, a closely related sequence to PBS2 was identified and oligonucleotides made against this region also bound Pax2. Binding to the PBS1 and PBS2 oligonucleotides could be inhibited with increasing amounts of unlabeled competitor DNA.

Unlabeled competitor DNAs from the high affinity Pax2-binding sequence H2A were added to test for specificity. In all cases, the pulled down fragments were competed out with an excess of unlabeled H2A Pax2-binding sequence. The Pax2-paired domain specifically bound strongly to two fragments that were subcloned, sequenced, and analyzed further by electrophoretic mobility shift experiments. They mapped within the potential regulatory region upstream of the Sfrp2 translation initiation site and both bound recombinant Pax2 protein in the region spanning -411 to -210, mapping around the DNaseI hypersensitive site II that is prominent only in the 28Pax2 cells. The ability of Pax2 to activate the Sfrp2 promoter region was examined in a heterologous system using transient transfections. The plasmid p2.8PX-CAT fused a 2.8-kb PstI-XhoI upstream of the CAT reporter gene. Transfection into HEK293 or NIH3T3 cells together with increasing amounts of a Pax2 expression plasmid reveals an ability of Pax2 to transactivate directly this promoter region. Activation of reporter gene expression was 2-fold in the presence of Pax2b protein. Although this was not as robust as other Pax2-responsive elements described, the activation was statistically significant and reproducible.

It has been shown that the function of Pax7 partially overlaps with the paralogous Pax3 gene during development, which might explain the lack of a discernable phenotype in Pax7 mutant mice during somite formation. Both genes strongly stimulate cell proliferation in various tissues.	15688409	DNA Binding; Transactivation	Human; Mouse	Strong	EMSA was used to characterize the DNA binding properties of the 6 wild-type PAX3 and PAX7 isoforms (PAX3/Q+, PAX3/Q-, PAX7/Q+GL+, PAX7/Q+GL-, PAX7/Q-GL+ and PAX7/Q-GL-). Each isoform formed a single shifted band with 32P-labeled P6CON or PRS-9 probe representative of the DNA-protein complex. The specificity of the complexes was further confirmed by the fact that the shifted bands disappeared when unlabeled competitor probes were included in the binding reaction at 50- or 200-fold molar excesses over labeled probes, whereas the DNA-protein complexes remained undisturbed when excess unlabeled nonspecific competitor was added. PAX7/Q-GL- exhibited the highest binding affinity, which is 4.7-fold higher than that of PAX7/Q+GL+ form.Reporter assays were performed to investigate the functional differences among the various isoforms. The ability of PAX7-FKHR to transactivate the expression of reporter plasmids 6xCD19-E1b-CAT and 6xPRS-9-E1b-CAT, which have 6 copies of the class I CD19 or class II PRS-9 binding site upstream of the TATA element of the E1b promoter was examined. Among the PAX7-FKHR isoforms, Q-GL- showed the highest transcriptional activation with the 6xCD19-E1b-CAT reporter (about 50-fold of that of the Q+GL+ form), followed by Q+GL- and Q-GL+ isoforms (about 2-3 fold of that of the Q+GL+ form).

Also, Etv4 interacts directly with an Ets-binding site oligonucleotide in complex with transcription factors ETS-1 and ERM, and interacts indirectly with the murine bax promoter in complex with transcription factor USF-1, as demonstrated by mobility shift assays.	15138262	DNA Binding	Mouse	Strong	A mobility shift indicative of an interaction between mouse Etv4 (referred to by alias PEA3 in this PMID) and the Ets-binding site sequence were observed in an EMSA assay in which E10 cell nuclear extracts were incubated with radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe corresponding encoding the Ets-binding site.

Transrepression refers to the ability of PR-A to suppress the transcriptional activity of PR-B and other nuclear receptors, including estrogen receptors. Self-squelching refers to the observation in transient transfection assays that increasing receptor concentrations paradoxically decrease transcriptional activity.

This is a well-known TF.  1980478	    DNA Binding	Unknown	   Strong    "The ubiquitous octamer-binding protein oct-1 contains a POU domain required for DNA binding, which can be subdivided into a POU-specific domain and a POU homeo domain. We have overproduced the POU domain and the POU homeo domain in a vaccinia expression system, purified both polypeptides to near homogeneity, and compared their DNA-binding properties. In contrast to the POU domain, the homeo domain protects only part of the octamer sequence in the Ad2 origin against breakdown by DNase I or hydroxyl radicals. Analysis of purine contacts by DMS and DEPC interference assays shows that the Ad2 octamer can be divided into two regions: one that is recognized both by the POU domain and the homeo domain in an identical fashion, and one that is only recognized by the POU domain. This suggests that the POU-specific domain is responsible for the additional contacts located at one side of the octamer. In agreement with this, mutating the first 3 nucleotides (ATG) of the octamer affected binding by the POU domain but not by the homeo domain. The apparent binding affinities to different octamer sites were compared. The homeo domain binds 600-fold less efficiently to the canonical octamer sequence (ATGCAAAT) than the POU domain. The difference is only sevenfold for the Ad2 octamer, whereas both Kd values are almost identical for the HSV ICP4 TAATGARAT motif. Both the POU and homeo domains recognize target sequences for mammalian homeo box proteins. We conclude that the octamer can act as a bipartite recognition sequence for oct-1 and that the POU-specific domain contributes to the binding affinity, as well as to the specificity, by providing additional contacts."

Here, we have determined the DNA binding property of Oct-3/4 in a systematic manner using all possible one point mutants of Octamer sequence as well as completely random sequences. These analyses led to the identification of nine distinct nucleotide sequences including the one (5'-ACTAGCAT-3') present in UTF1 regulatory element which serves rather as specific binding site for the Oct-3/4. Moreover, we show that, at least, one of the newly identified sequences, 5'-ATCAGCAT-3', exhibits a transcriptional stimulating activity equivalent to that of the variant Octamer sequence present in the UTF1 regulatory region in embryonic stem cells in a pluripotent-state specific manner.

RX does not bind detectably to a mouse PCE-1 core mutated from CAATTAG to CAACCAG. Through co-transfection RX is shown to stimulate expression of the mouse arrestin promoter.

The PCE-1 element of the mouse arrestin gene was shown to be bound by protein when incubated with human GST-RX fusion protein. Supershifts using anti-GST antibody further indicated that the GST-RX fusion protein was the factor that was binding to the PCE-1 site. Also, cotransfection of RX with mouse arrestin-lacZ and IRBP-lacZ constructs in 293 cell lines led to increases in reporter activity.	10625658	DNA Binding	Human; Mouse	Strong	GeneID: 19434Referring to PMID: 10625658Rax is likely a transcription factor that binds to the upstream PCE-1 element of the mouse arrestin gene. Using EMSA, mobility shift is observed when the m-PCE-1 element is incubated with GST-Rax protein. This shift is competed significantly by a 40-fold molar excess of unlabeled m-PCE-1 competitor, but only slightly by a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled m-OTX competitor. The bound protein was also identified to be Rax by supershift assays. EMSA was also performed using purified GST-Rax and oligonucleotide probes containing the identical mouse (-21 CAATTAG -15) and bovine upstream (-1830 CAATTAG -1824) PCE-1 site. These oligonucleotides bound strongly to GST-Rax to form complexes (Fig. 6, lanes 1-10) suggesting that the PCE-1 core consensus (CAATTA(G/A)) was an essential binding element and the flanking sequence contributed minimally to the observed binding activity. Rax may activate arrestin promoter activity. Human Rax and the mouse arrestin promoter/CAT reporter constructs are cotransfected into human embryonic kidney (293) cells which exhibit no endogenous Rax expression. Co-transfection of human Rax stimulates promoter activity reaching 6.4-fold induction.

The three isoforms, referred to as ROR alpha 1, ROR alpha 2, and ROR alpha 3, share common DNA- and putative ligand-binding domains but are characterized by distinct amino-terminal domains generated by alternative RNA processing. An exon encoding a functionally important subregion of the amino-terminal domain of the ROR alpha 2 isoform resides on the opposite strand of a cytochrome c-processed pseudogene. Binding site selection using in vitro-synthesized proteins reveals that the ROR alpha 1 and ROR alpha 2 isoforms bind DNA as monomers to hormone response elements composed of a 6-bp AT-rich sequence preceding a half-site core motif PuGGTCA (RORE). However, ROR alpha 1 and ROR alpha 2 display different binding specificities: ROR alpha 1 binds to and constitutively activates transcription from a large subset of ROREs, whereas ROR alpha 2 recognizes ROREs with strict specificity and displays weaker transcriptional activity. The differential DNA-binding activity of each isoform maps to their respective amino-terminal domains. Whereas truncation of the amino-terminal domain diminishes the ability of ROR alpha 1 to bind DNA, a similar deletion relaxes ROR alpha 2-binding specificity to that displayed by ROR alpha 1. Remarkably, transfer of the entire amino-terminal region of ROR alpha 1 or amino-terminal deletion of ROR alpha 2 confers RORE-binding specificities to heterologous receptors. These results demonstrate that the amino-terminal domain and the zinc finger region work in concert to confer high affinity and specific DNA-binding properties to the ROR isoforms and suggest a novel strategy to control DNA-binding activity of nuclear receptors."

The predicted protein products of RXR&#945;2 and RXR&#945;3 lack the N-terminal 27 and 97 amino acid residues in the region containing AF-1 of RXRa1. Since AF-1 activates transcription either by itself, depending on the cell and promoter context, or synergistically with AF-2 in a ligand-dependent manner, we examined whether the products of RXRa2 and RXR&#945;3 can function as a nuclear receptor and further whether they function differently from the product of RXRa1. The products of RXRa2 and RXRa3 were confirmed to be able to activate transcription and responded to ligand dose-dependently, as shown by dual luciferase reporter gene assay using RXRE as a response element and the RXR agonist LG100268. LG100268 is a highly RXR-selective synthetic retinoid analogs and is known to activate RXR�RXR homodimer as well as RXR heterodimers such as RXR�PPAR&#947; and RXR�LXR [27] and [28]. There were no significant differences in the ligand dose�response curves between RXR&#945;1 and RXR&#945;2 or RXR&#945;3. A major role of RXR seems to be to function as a coreceptor by forming a heterodimer with other nuclear receptors. Therefore, transactivation by the PPAR&#947;2�RXR&#945; heterodimer, using PPRE as a response element, was tested. As in the homodimer system, there were no significant differences in transactivation ability and ligand response between RXR&#945;1 and RXR&#945;2 or RXR&#945;3.

IR0-tk-luc reporter construct is activated by the addition of RAR and RXR expression vectors in a dose-dependent manner, but construct with mutated IR0 is not. EMSA with IR0 and nuclear extracts from COS-1 cells shows intense DNA binding signal only when induced with retinoic acid.

It binds HDAC1/HDAC2 complex by coimmunoprecipitation assays and potentiates the inhibitory function of HDAC1 on the hLHR promoter reporter gene by cotransfection in reporter gene assays.	12091390	Other; TF PPI	Human	Strong	Transfection of wild type hLHR promoter/reporter gene construct (WT) and the promoterless vector plasmid (Basic) into JAR cells proceeded with TSA incubation (TSA is a specific HDAC inhibitor) shows a dose-dependent activation of the hLHR promoter activity by TSA demonstrating that  transcription of the hLHR gene is subject to modulation through chromatin modification related to histone acetylation and deacetylation. RT-PCR analyses of total RNA isolated from the JAR cells treated with or without TSA demonstrates that the endogenous expression of the hLHR gene governed by its natural promoter is regulated by TSA.Acetylated H3 and H4 accumulates only in TSA-treated JAR cells and is predominantly bound to the human LHR gene promoter (by Western blot analyses using antibodies against the aceylated form of histone H3 or H4 and chromatin immunoprecipitation - precipitated with antibodies against acetylated H3, H4, or RNA polymerase II).The Sp1-1 site is critical for TSA-mediated activation/derepression of hLHR Gene by reporter gene analyses utilizing the hLHR wild type promoter (WT) and its various mutant constructs.Binding of Sp1/Sp3 to the Sp1-1 site was not affected by TSA (by EMSA/supershifts).Coimmunoprecipitation assays reveal an association of histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2 with the Sp1-1 complex. Direct association between mSin3A and either HDAC1 or HDAC2 is shown by co-precipitation by both HDAC antibodies but mSin3A is not revealed in the presence of Sp1 or Sp3 antibody, indicating that there is no direct protein-protein interaction between mSin3A and the Sp1/Sp3 factors.Cotransfection of mSin3A with HDAC1 in JAR cells signficantly enhanced the repression of hLHR promoter activity by HDAC1 (to 70%). However, cotransfection of mSin3A and HDAC2 does not cause further inhibition of hLHR promoter activity when compared with that elicited by HDAC2 alone suggesting that mSin3A is a corepressor protein that potentiates the inhibitory function of HDAC1.

Gel retardation assays show that both mouse Dec1 and mouse Dec2 bound to mouse Per1 proximal E-box elements. The binding was specific to an E-box, because excess dose of unlabelled E-box but not mutant E-box inhibited the binding.   Yeast two-hybrid assay revealed that both Dec1 and Dec2 bound stereospecifically to Bmal1. Dec1 and Dec2 lacking the C-terminal regions were able to bind to Bmal1 as did the full-length Decs, but those lacking the amino terminal failed to bind, suggesting the bHLH is the responsible site.

Co-immunoprecipitation assays using various flag-tagged Smad proteins together with Suv39h1 demonstrate that Suv39h proteins interact specifically with Smad1 and Smad5.Different constructs of myc-tagged Suv39h1 in co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that Smad1 (and presumably Smad5) binds to an internal region of Suv39h1 molecule. Cotransfection of increasing amounts of Suv39h1 with constitutively activated BMP receptor type I, Alk3, in C2C12 myoblasts caused a dose-dependent decrease in MCK promoter activity. Cotransfection of Smad1, Suv39h1 and Alk3 significanty reduced the MCK promoter activity in this system.Cotransfection of an Suv39h1 construct lacking the SET domain (the methyltransferase domain) in 10T1/2 cell with an MCK promoter-reporter drastically reduced the cooperative effects of Alk3 and Suv39h1 on MCK inhibition in cells .

In vitro assays had shown that HTF4 can form heterodimers with other bHLH proteins of class A (e.g., the E2A proteins) and class B (e.g., the myogenic factors; MYF3, MYF5, and MYF6), as well as the inhibitor of DNA binding (ID1) and stem cell leukemia hematopoietic transcription factor (TAL1).	8163514	DNA Binding	Mouse	Strong	In DNA binding assays, (Doyle et al., 1994) found that complexes of HTF4 with the myogenic factors have a relatively high affinity for the E box motifs of the mE2 (CACGTG) and kappa E2/muE5 (CACCTG) types, whereas heterodimers of HTF4 and TAL1 interact poorly. They suggested that these results and those obtained from transient expression studies indicated that leukemogenesis caused by TAL1 might include a pathway where TAL1 would act as a negative regulator of gene expression by forming a complex with class A bHLH proteins

The clone is highly homologous to Hela cell TEF-1. The in vitro transcription/translation product of mTEF-1 cDNA bound to the A element, and the DNA binding property of mTEF-1 was identical to that of the A2 factor. Transfection of mTEF-1 cDNA into muscle and non-muscle cells confirmed that mTEF-1 corresponds to A2, but not to A1 factors. The mTEF-1 mRNA is expressed abundantly in skeletal and cardiac muscles, kidney and lung, but it is also expressed at lower levels in other tissues. These results suggest that the M-CAT binding factors consist of two different factors; the ubiquitous A2 is encoded by mTEF-1, but the muscle-specific A1 factor is distinct from mTEF-1.

Endogenously expressed {alpha}-globin protein is detected when both CP2b and CP2c are overexpressed in MEL cells by fluorescein isothiocyanate (green)-conjugated secondary antibody with anti-hemoglobin. The transcriptional activation domain resides in the N terminus of CP2b by yeast-one hybrid. EMAS assays demonstrate that CP2b binds DNA poorly.EMSAs in which CP2b is added with CP2a or CP2c in the reaction mixture at different times demonstrates that erythroid cell-specific transcriptional activation of CP2b is mediated by the interaction with another CP2 isoform(s) that occupy the CP2c binding site in the {alpha}-globin promoter.Yeast-two hybrid analysis and ChIp assays (in MEL cells) indicate that PIAS1 is a component in the CP2b/CP2c complex in CP2b mediated {alpha}-globin gene expression. EMSAs, supershift and  {alpha}-globin promoter-reporter assays in confirm the complex CP2b/CP2c/PIAS1 and its ability to transactivate the reporter gene.

In the human complex designated as NuRD, this protein was reported as the product of the MTA2 gene. In contrast, MTA1 was identified as a component of a strikingly similar human complex termed NURD. In the Mi-2 complex isolated from the amphibian X. laevis, the subunit of similar size was identified as MTA1-like, a gene product now recognized to be the ortholog of mammalian MTA2. Finally, the HDAC1 cII complex was reported to contain MTA2 as well as two ‘truncated forms’ of MTA2.	11749719	Transactivation	Mouse	Weak	The entire mmta2 protein repressed the transcription of the reporter genes, whereas treatment with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), led to recovery from the repression and to transcriptional activation. However, the N terminus of mmta2 activated transcriptional activity in the absence of TSA. These results suggest that mmta2 has the potential to both repress and activate gene transcription and that its transcription repression activity might be related to histone deacetylation.

Glycerol gradient sedimentation supports that DRIPs bound together with VDR as a multimeric complex, and Far Western assay on DRIP eluate using GST-VDR LBD as probes suggest that only a subset of the DRIPs can bind to VDR directly. Cell-free transcription assay with GST-VDR and associated DRIPs showed that VDR-RXR transcription increases by 3-fold when DRIP is present as well.

GST pull-down assay showed that TRAP100 weakly interacts with TRAP220, which did bind to NRs, but other attempts to elucidate direct interaction in vitro failed.

We confirmed E1B-AP5-BRD7 complex formation in vivo and in vitro. We found that, although BRD7 binds to histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 through its bromodomain, this domain was not necessary for the interaction with E1B-AP5. Indeed, the triple complex formation of E1B-AP5, BRD7 and histones was demonstrated. Disruption of the E1B-AP5-BRD7 complex increased E1B-AP5 repression activity for basic transcription and converted it from being an activator of the hormone-dependent promoter into being a strong repressor. We conclude that complex formation between BRD7 and E1B-AP5 links chromatin events with mRNA processing at the level of transcriptional regulation."

When cotransfected with adiponectin reporter constructs, NFATc4 stimulated 50% increases in reporter activity. Futhermore, these increases in reporter expression were observed only in the presence of the putative NFAT-binding site. Using EMSA assays, NFATc4 was also shown to interact with a 20 bp region within the adiponectin promoter from mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes, mouse white adipose tissue, and human HEK293 kidney cells. In addition, ChIP assays were also performed, lending in-vivo confidence to this claim.	16644691	DNA Binding; Transactivation	Human; Mouse	Strong	GeneID: 73181Referring to PMID: 16644691Function: Transactivation (strong)NFATc4 represses adiponectin promoter activity dependent on the putative NFAT binding site. Cotransfection of NFATc4 (species not specified) expression vector and mouse adiponectin-luciferase reporter constructs into fully differentiated mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes led to significant reductions in promoter activity (50%) relative to controls. Appropriate controls were also included; NFATc1, c2, and c3 all failed to reduce promoter activity. So NFATc4 is likely responsible for repression of adiponectin expression in the natural promoter context. Function: Transactivation based upon a specific DNA region (strong)Repression of adiponectin promoter activity by NFATc4 is dependent upon the repressor region containing the putative NFATC4 binding site. Additional cotransfection assays were performed with mouse adiponectin promoter constructs in which the putative NFAT binding site is included or excluded. The promoter activities of reporters including the binding site were reduced by NFATc4, while those with the binding site excluded were unaffected. Taken together, these results demonstrate that NFATc4 represses the promoter activity of adiponectin genes, dependent upon the putative NFAT binding site (�363 to �344) of the mouse adiponectin promoter.Function: DNA-binding (strong)NFATc4 was shown to interact directly with a 20-bp region of the adiponectin promoter containing the putative NFAT-binding site. EMSAs using nuclear extracts from fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, mouse white adipose tissue, and human HEK293 kidney cells were performed. For this experiment, a 20-bp wild-type oligonucleotide (�363 to �344) was designed that cover the putative NFAT binding site containing the core sequence of the NFAT response element (GGAAA) (Fig. 3A). Using nuclear extracts from both 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 3B, left panel) and mouse white adipose tissue (Fig. 3B, middle panel), binding complexes were observed with the labeled 20-bp oligonucleotides. Competitive inhibitors were also able to eliminate the mobility shift. To identify the protein binding to the putative NFAT site as NFATc4, a supershift assay was conducted using anti-NFATc4. Anti-NFATc4 shifted the binding complex. In contrast, no supershifted complex was detected with anti-STAT-1 (Fig. 3B). The evidence from this EMSA is strong due to the comprehensive set of controls that were included.

JDP2 represses DRE-dependent transactivation by ATF-2 and p300 in F9 cells by CAT reporter assay.Transient expression of JDP2 inhibits retinoic acid (RA)-mediated activation of a c-jun promoter construct reporter in F9 cells. Stably transfected F9 cells with c-jun-CAT reporter and JDP2 expression vector demonstrates that JDP2 inhibits RA-mediated activation of the c-jun promoter. JDP2 also repressed (RA mediated) transcription of the c-jun gene (by Northern blotting).Immunoprecipitaton of proteins recruited by JDP2 in extracts of F9 cells with antibodies against JDP2 demonstrate HDAC activity (by assays of HDAC activity). HDAC3 is part of the DRF complex that becomes associated with JDP2 in nuclear extracts in  F9 cells (with antibodies against HDAC1 through HDAC6) by EMSA. Overexpression of JDP2 suppresses RA-mediated morphological changes in F9 cells that are associated with differentiation by measurement of RA-inducible gene expression with real-time RT-PCR.

Luciferase expression increased synergistically upon the additional transfection of an expression plasmid encoding either Tbx4 or Tbx5. This synergism was eliminated upon the usage of a reporter vector with a mutation within the Tbx5 binding site (T-Box element). Cotransfection of expression vectors for Tbx2 or Tbx3 along with that for Sall4, Tbx5, and a reporter vector, prevented the activation of luciferase gene expression.  Sall4 activated Gja5 promoter expression and suppressed Nppa promoter expression in co-transfection assays, in which an expression vector for Sall4 was transfected into 10T1/2 cells along with a reporter plasmid consisting of either the Gja5 promoter or Nppa promoter fused to luciferase.

The TAFs are required for activated rather than basal transcription and serve to mediate signals between various activators and the basal transcriptional machinery. Taf9 is one of these TBP-associated factors.Klemm et al. (1995) cloned a human TFIID subunit, which they termed hTAFII32. The 32-kD protein was isolated from HeLa cell nuclear extracts and partially sequenced. A degenerate oligomer was designed and used to probe a human HeLa cell cDNA library. The identified cDNA has a deduced amino acid sequence of 264 residues and is related to the Drosophila TAFII40. Klemm et al. (1995) showed that TAFII32 interacts with GTF2B and with the viral transcriptional transactivator VP16. The authors showed that recombinantly expressed TAFII32 was functional in a partial recombinant TFIID complex and that the recombinant complex mediated activation by a GAL4-VP16 fusion protein. Lu and Levine (1995) cloned TAF9, which they called TAFII31. TAF9 encodes a 264-amino acid protein. Immunoprecipitation and binding analyses showed interaction of TAF9 with the N-terminal domain of p53 at sites identical to those bound by MDM2, the major cellular negative regulator of p53 activity. Antibodies to TAF9 inhibited p53-activated transcription. Lu and Levine (1995) concluded that p53 activity is regulated by 2 proteins competing for the same region of the p53 protein.	7597030	TF PPI	Human	Strong	Transcription factor TFIID consists of TATA binding protein (TBP) and at least eight TBP-associated factors (TAFs). As TAFs are required for activated but not basal transcription, we have proposed that TAFs act as coactivators to mediate signals between activators and the basal transcription machinery. Here we report the cloning, expression, and biochemical characterization of the 32-kDa subunit of human (h) TFIID, termed hTAFII32. We find that hTAFII32 is the human homologue of Drosophila TAFII40. In vitro protein-protein interaction assays reveal that as observed with Drosophila TAFII40, hTAFII32 interacts with the C-terminal 39-amino acid activation domain of the acidic transactivator viral protein 16 (VP16) as well as with the general transcription factor TFIIB. Moreover, a partial recombinant TFIID complex containing hTAFII32 was capable of mediating in vitro transcriptional activation by the VP16 activation domain. These findings indicate that specific activator-coactivator interactions have been conserved between human and Drosophila and provide additional support for the function of these interactions in mediating transcriptional activation.

The amino-terminal domain of p53 interacts with a component of the TFIID basal transcription complex. The human TATA-binding-protein-associated factor TAFII31, a component of TFIID, has been identified as a critical protein required for p53-mediated transcriptional activation. TAFII31 and p53 proteins bind to each other via amino acid residues in the amino-terminal domain of p53 that are essential for transcription. Antibodies directed against TAFII31 protein inhibit p53-activated but not basal transcription in vitro. These results demonstrate that TAFII31 is a coactivator for the p53 protein.

The mouse alphaA-crystallin -73/-55 region stimulated the tk promoter in alphaTN2-1 cells but not in any of the other cell lines. The alphaA-CRYBP1 site (GGGAAATCCC) alone augmented the activity of the tk promoter 3-4x in alphaTN2-1 cells but not in any of the other cell lines. Mutation of the site eliminated transcriptional activity of the alphaA-crystallin promoter.Oligos containing two, three, or four copies of mouse alphaA-CRYBP1 site were cloned into pTKCAT upstream of the tk promoter and used for transfection. CAT activity increased with copy number in all transfected cell types. Preliminary gel mobility shift assays indicate that both alphaTN4-1 and L929 nuclear extracts produced multiple DNA-protein complexes with the mouse alphaA-CRYBP1 site, despite the lack of transactivation in L929.

Tle6 associates with transcription factor BF-1 as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation, and modulates the transcriptional repression activity of BF-1 as demonstrated by cotransfection. As well, Tle6 cannot inherently repress transcription, and does not inherently modulate the ability of Tle1 to repress transcription as demonstrated by cotransfection. Instead it is thought that it may compete with Tle1 for binding to BF-1 and thereby bring about decreased gene expression.	16314515	TF PPI	Mouse	Strong	Tle6 (referred to by its alias Grg6 in this PMID) co-immunoprecipitated with BF-1 in a co-immunoprecipitation assay in which FLAG-BF1 was immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts of HEK293 cells co-transfected with FLAG-BF1 and GFP-Tle6 using anti-FLAG, and GFP-Tle6 was detected by Western blotting using anti-GFP.Tle6 modulated the transcriptional repression activity of BF-1, producing an increase in reporter expression relative to just BF-1 and reporter, in a cotransfection assay in which HEK293 cells were cotransfected with expression vectors for Tle6 and BF-1, as well as a reporter construct vector consisting of six tandem copies of a BF-1 binding site fused to luciferase. This modulative effect of Tle6 was antagonized by the further transfection of Tle1. Tle6 had no effect on reporter gene expression when cotransfected with a mutant form of BF-1 unable to bind DNA and thereby mediate reporter repression. Tle1 fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain repressed reporter expression in a cotransfection assay in which HeLa cells were cotransfected with an expression vector for Tle1-GAL4DBD along with a reporter construct vector consisting of five tandem copies of a GAL4 binding site fused to luciferase. No reporter gene repression was observed upon cotransfection of Tle6-GALDBD expression plasmid and reporter plasmid into HeLa cells. Tle6 did not impede the ability of BF-1-binding protein Tle1 fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain to repress reporter expression when cotransfected into HeLa cells with an expression vector for Tle-1 along with a reporter construct consisting of five tandem repeats of the GAL4 upstream activation sequence and the SV40 promoter fused to luciferase.

Deletion of the putative transmembrane domain increased activation, suggesting that the transmembrane domain may be involved in modulating activity.	11353085	DNA Binding; Transactivation	Human	Strong	In the initial screening experiment with RT�PCR, the authors observed the liver-specific expression of CREB-H using 16 human tissues. To confirm this observation, they performed northern blotting analysis with the 16 human tissues.  To determine whether CREB-H is a transcription activator, plasmids expressing GAL4�CREB-H fusion proteins were produced and co-transfected with a luciferase-reporter plasmid containing the GAL4 DNA-binding element into COS7 cells.  CREB-H functioned as a transcriptional activator and its N-terminal 149 amino acids accounted for the activation ability. Fusion proteins of GST and CREB-H lacking the putative transmembrane domain were produced in bacteria and purified by glutathione�Sepharose 4B. The Gel mobility shift assays revealed that CREB-H did not bind to the C/EBP, AP-1 and NF-B elements but specifically bound to CRE and the box-B element. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that like BBF-2, CREB-H activated transcription via the box-B element and that a deletion of the putative transmembrane domain increased the activation of reporter expression significantly. Using COS7 cells, a fusion protein of GFP and full-length CREB-H was localized in reticular structures surrounding the nucleus, whereas a fusion protein of GFP and a deletion mutant lacking the putative transmembrane domain was mainly in the nucleus.

EMSA was performed to confirm that the consensus sequence represented a high-affinity HLF-binding site with an oligonucleotide containing the consensus site with and without 100-fold excess unlabelled competitor DNAs. The HLF complex was fully inhibited by an excess of unlabelled HLF consensus site and unaffected by a 100-fold excess of an unrelated binding site for the PBX1 protein. SAAB was also performed for E2A-HLF fusion protein, which bound to the same sequence but with tighter adherance to the the consensus than wt HLF.The transcriptional regulatory properties of wt HLF and E2A-HLF were investigated by cotransfection of expression vectors into mammalian cells along with reporter constructs containing a CAT gene under control of either the HSV TK or liver, bone, and kidney alkaline phosphatase promoters linked to concatamerized binding sites. In CV-1 cells, HLF strongly activated reporter gene transcription through HLF consensus binding sites and was a less potent activator of reporters containing VTG II sties.

Bmal1 and Per transcription cycles display nearly opposite phases and are thus governed by different mechanisms. Here, authors identify the orphan nuclear receptor REV-ERBalpha as the major regulator of cyclic Bmal1 transcription. Circadian Rev-erbalpha expression is controlled by components of the general feedback loop. Thus, REV-ERBalpha constitutes a molecular link through which components of the negative limb drive antiphasic expression of components of the positive limb. While REV-ERBalpha influences the period length and affects the phase-shifting properties of the clock, it is not required for circadian rhythm

The c-fos SRE is regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation of ternary complex factor (TCF) but is also regulated by a RhoA-dependent pathway. The mechanism of this pathway is unclear. Since MKL1 (also known as MAL, BSAC, and MRTF-A) is broadly expressed, we assessed its role in serum induction of c-fos and other SRE-regulated genes with a dominant negative MKL1 mutant (DN-MKL1) and RNA interference (RNAi). We found that DN-MKL1 and RNAi specifically blocked SRE-dependent reporter gene activation by serum and RhoA. Complete inhibition by RNAi required the additional inhibition of the related factor MKL2 (MRTF-B), showing the redundancy of these factors. DN-MKL1 reduced the late stage of serum induction of endogenous c-fos expression, suggesting that the TCF- and RhoA-dependent pathways contribute to temporally distinct phases of c-fos expression. Furthermore, serum induction of two TCF-independent SRE target genes, SRF and vinculin, was nearly completely blocked by DN-MKL1. Finally, the RBM15-MKL1 fusion protein formed by the t(1;22) translocation of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia had a markedly increased ability to activate SRE reporter genes, suggesting that its activation of SRF target genes may contribute to leukemogenesis. Method for EMSA:Gel mobility shift assays. MKL1 was in vitro transcribed and translated from pcDNA3.1-MKL1-HA, which contains a T7 promoter upstream of MKL1 and a C-terminal HA tag, with an STP3 kit (Novagen). In vitro-translated MKL1 (5 to 8 �l) and bacterially expressed SRF (amino acids 114 to 508) (10 ng) were used with a high-affinity SRF binding site, XGL, as a probe (47). SRF (amino acids 114 to 508) with an N-terminal polyhistidine tag was expressed in pET28b in E. coli and purified with a nickel-chelate resin (Novagen). The double-stranded oligonucleotide probe XGL was end labeled with [-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The samples were incubated with 1 ng of probe in 20 �l of binding buffer (40 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 60 mM spermidine, 1 �g of sheared herring sperm DNA) for 1 h at room temperature and then separated on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25x TBE (25 mM Tris base, 25 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA), dried, and exposed to film.

Transcription requires CK2 phosphorylation of the pol III complex. In contrast, CK2 phosphorylation of TBP, Brf2, and Bdp1 combined is inhibitory. The results define a minimum core machinery, the ultimate target of regulatory mechanisms, capable of directing all steps of the transcription process-initiation, elongation, and termination-by a metazoan RNA polymerase, and suggest positive and negative regulatory roles for CK2 in transcription by pol III.

COPR2 is an alternative splice variant of COPR1 and homologue of rat NRBF-2.  Fusion products of COPR1 and COPR2 and their truncated versions with GAL4-DNA binding domain shows the presence of auto-activation domain. COPR1:PPAR interactions yield much higher reporter expression than COPR2:PPAR. Mutation of NR box on COPR1/COPR2 leads to decrease in reporter activity. Mutation of the AF-2 region of RXRalpha leads to decrease in reporter activity in yeast, which is also supported by mammlian two-hybrid studies.  COPR1/COPR2 partially represses RXR activity in HaCaT cells.
