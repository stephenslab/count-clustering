All documents related to this work are in the `project` folder. The
remaining folders contain files used to generate the webpages. The
`project` folder hosts several sub-directories---we list their
functionalities below:

+ `project/src` hosts the RMD scripts as well as the HTML outputs from these files.

+ `project/R` hosts the R scripts, mostly scripts that run specific
analysis on data or derived data. Also includes scripts generating figures for the paper.

+ `project/plots` hosts all the plots obtained by running the R and RMD
scripts.

+ `project/rdas` hosts the rda files storing lists or complex data
derived from running R/RMD scripts.

+ `project/talks`  talks and presentations related to this project

+ `project/docs` current draft, submitted draft and bioRxiv draft of the paper.

+ `project/utilities` hosts supplementary data - gene lists from the analysis, gene annotations etc.
